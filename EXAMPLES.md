# Go PI Web API Examples

The examples I am about to show you will require a little bit of knowledge of how PI Web API works since we do not have a handy WebID builder *yet*.

If you're wondering what a WebID is, it's this static ID that's on all objects you put into the PI System.  See here:

![Web ID](./webid.png)

You can get the [full Web ID 2.0 spec](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/blog/2018/01/26/pi-web-api-web-id-20-specification-tables) on PI Dev Club as well as [a video and instructions](https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/blog/2018/01/26/pi-web-api-using-web-id-20-to-optimize-your-applications) on how to decode them.

## Setting up an HTTP Client
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"log"

	pi "github.com/christoofar/gowebapi"
)

// The http client is best shared.
var cfg = pi.NewConfiguration()
var client *pi.APIClient
var auth context.Context

func Init() {
	cfg.BasePath = "https://myhostname.mycompany.com/piwebapi"
	//TODO Fix this
	auth = context.WithValue(context.Background(), pi.ContextBasicAuth, pi.BasicAuth{
		UserName: "COMPANY\MyID",
		Password: "p@$$w0rd",
	})
	client = pi.NewAPIClient(cfg)
}

func main() {
	Init()
}
```

Here I have stood up a global http client that is ready to send requests to the PI Web API endpoint.   I have replaced the "gowebapi" package name with the faster-to-type mnemonic called `pi`.

If you try to compile this, Go will immediately complain that the variable `auth` is not being used.   That's because it isn't.  It is the security context used to send stateless web requests.   To make the error go away we need to use `auth` in something.

## Getting an AF Attribute
At my office I have a AF database called `Chris` where I have some of my computers being monitored by PI Perfmon.  I would like to see the details about the Attribute I created called `Memory % In Use` hanging off a machine called CLSAF, which also happens to be my PI Server. 

**Keep in mine that my WebIDs will not work in your environment.  You can use a web browser to manually find the WebIDs in your system by going to https://youirserver/piwebapi.**


![Here's my AF](./af1.png)

To get at that attribute's detail, let's call `AttributeGet`

```go
func GetAttribute() {

	// Construct the PathOnly WebID for \\CLSAF\Chris\CLSAF|Memory % In Use

	// See https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club/blog/2018/01/26/pi-web-api-web-id-20-specification-tables
	webid := "P1AbE"     // <-- We're telling the server this is an AF Attribute hanging off an AF Element
	webid += "Q0xTQUZcQ0hSSVNcQ0xTQUZ8TUVNT1JZICUgSU4gVVNF" // CLSAF\CHRIS\CLSAF|MEMORY % IN USE
	options := make(map[string]interface{})
	options["webIdType"] = "PathOnly"

	value, resp, err := client.AttributeApi.AttributeGet(auth, webid, options)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("The call to WebAPI failed [", resp.StatusCode, "]")
		body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		log.Fatal(string(body))
	}

	fmt.Println("ã€‹CLSAF\\Chris\\Memory % In Use")
	fmt.Println("  ConfigString:\t", value.ConfigString)
	fmt.Println("   Path:\t", value.Path)
	fmt.Println("   WebId:\t", value.WebId)
}
```
Add a call to this `func` in your main() and then compile and run your program.  I've enhanced my program a bit more than the example, but you get the idea:

## Recorded Values (the PIPoint way)

Here's how to pull some recorded values out of a PI Point (aka "PI tag")

```go
func GetSiusoidTag() {

	webid := "P1DP"                // <-- This is a PI Point
	webid += "Q0xTQUZcU0lOVVNPSUQ" // <-- Whose path is CLSAF\SINUSOID
	optionals := make(map[string]interface{})

	optionals["startTime"] = "*-5d"
	optionals["endTime"] = "*"
	optionals["maxCount"] = int32(5000)

	value, resp, err := client.StreamApi.StreamGetRecorded(auth, webid, optionals)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Couldn't get PI tag CLSAF\\SINUSOID [", resp.StatusCode, "] ", err)
	}

	// Let us split the data that came back into 2 arrays then print in two columns in the console.
	col1 := value.Items[0 : len(value.Items)/2]
	col2 := value.Items[len(value.Items)/2:]

	for i := 0; i < len(col1); i++ {
		fmt.Println(col1[i].Timestamp, "\t", *col1[i].Value, "\t",
			col2[i].Timestamp, "\t", *col2[i].Value)
	}
}
```

Result:
![here's the output](./af3.png)

## Recorded Values (the AF Attribute way)

Here's how to pull some recorded values out of an AF Attribute that has a DataReference.

```go
func GetRecordedValues() {
	webid := "P1AbE"     // <-- We're telling the server this is an AF Attribute hanging off an AF Element
	webid += "Q0xTQUZcQ0hSSVNcQ0xTQUZ8TUVNT1JZICUgSU4gVVNF" // CLSAF\CHRIS\CLSAF|MEMORY % IN USE
	optionals := make(map[string]interface{})

	optionals["endTime"] = "*"
	optionals["startTime"] = "*-100d"
	optionals["maxCount"] = int32(500)

	value, resp, err := client.StreamApi.StreamGetRecorded(auth, webid, optionals)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("The call to WebAPI failed [", resp.StatusCode, "]")
		body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		log.Fatal(string(body))
	}

	// Let us split the data that came back into 2 arrays to print in two columns in the console.
	col1 := value.Items[0 : len(value.Items)/2]
	col2 := value.Items[len(value.Items)/2:]

	for i := 0; i < len(col1); i++ {
		fmt.Println(col1[i].Timestamp, "\t", *col1[i].Value, "\t",
			col2[i].Timestamp, "\t", *col2[i].Value)
	}
}
```

Notice in the code that to retrieve the PIPoint values a pointer derefrence must occur.  Some variables in golang will be memory pointers which you must dereference.  Usually any variable that will accept a variety of structures will be by reference rather than by value.

A rule of thumb:  If you print a variable to the console and (0x00005244fff... is what you get back, you need to put a `*` in front of the variable to get at the array, map or struct that is behind it.

Result:
![here's the output](./af4.png)

Notice how the Go `map` datatype is able to handle a mix of data value types coming back.  A `map` is a name:value pair data type in golang.  Not everything will be a floating point number.   This means you need to check what comes back.
